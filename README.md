# Sorting Menu 
In sorting Menu, i use basic touchableopacity to get the styling look like in the mockup. Befor that i use Checkbox from native-base, but it quite hard to get the right style with the mockup. 

And for the function, i've made the function for each action. I cant looping it because they have different function on it.
